- Distributed System TCP/UDP Server Client Simulation 
- InterProcessCommunication Simulation, on Single Machine or Installation in Diffences Machine.

How it Works :

1. Using Python for Language Programming
2. If you use this program on Single Machine, just change the Host Name to "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"
3. If you use this program on Difference Machine but in Same Network, change the host to IP Target (go to Command Prompt -> ipconfig -> See your IP on the Active Network Adapter)
4. If you use this program on Difference Machine and Network,change host and replace it by your Public IP, check your IP Public on google (Search 'What's My IP')
